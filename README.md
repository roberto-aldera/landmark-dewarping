# landmark-dewarping
⚠️ Messy research code 👨‍🎓

Research code where we attempted to improve radar-only egomotion estimation by removing distortion effects in radar scans.
By "dewarping" the positions of extracted landmarks, we try and remove potential sources of error that arise in the final odometry estimates.
This turns out to be tricky, but was still a helpful learning exercise (and led to the success in circular motion estimation work).
